# critter-ranch

A game about flipping critters; you buy critters, fatten 'em up, and sell 'em off for profit.
Fattening has diminishing returns, making you want to buy more expensive breeds once you can afford them.
Some foods cause the critter to become more gluttonous, moody, playful, bitchy, nympho, etc; traits which specific buyers may pay a premium for.
