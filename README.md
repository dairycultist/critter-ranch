you can cook the same dish with different ingredients, but this changes the flavour profile. some customers will request specific flavour profiles which you should try to match closely to get a large tip! also, using more expensive ingredients also increases the tip, encouraging you to unlock more expensive crops.

fresh, sweet, savoury, spicy, bitter

my urge to pivot to a farming/cooking game for animal crossing creatures is powerful; maybe a good direction since it does give a bit more of a setting and gameplay direction to the game
